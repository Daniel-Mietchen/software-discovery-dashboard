# software-discovery-dashboard

##Synopsis

Taking advantage of a new standard metadata schema used to map between different research code sharing API’s (Zenodo, Figshare, GitHub, etc), we want to create a web dashboard capable of searching these services’ content based on certain criteria. The dashboard’s goal is not only to offer indexing of research code, but also to demonstrate the usefulness of the metadata standard through easy and effective software discovery and analysis.
